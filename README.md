# Icebreaker!

Need to get people talking? Break the ice and uncover a fun icebreaker question!

The Icebreaker app is a simple web-based tool designed to help people spark conversations by randomly generating engaging icebreaker questions. Itâ€™s great for meetings, social events, or just getting to know someone better.

### This project showcases:
- DOM manipulation
- HTML/CSS structure and styling
- Clean code and UI without a frontend framework
- Creation of a responsive, interactive user experience

### How it works:
1. Click the "Break the Ice!" button to break away the ice block and reveal a randomized icebreaker question
2. When the ice is broken and the question is shown, a "Refreeze" button becomes available while the "Break the Ice" button is disabled, utilizing basic state logic
3. Click "Refreeze" to generate another block of ice
4. The "Refreeze" button will then disable, allowing you to "Break the Ice" again to reveal a new icebreaker
